# NoSql-social-api

## Description
My project is a way to have a database keep track of users, friends of each user, their thoughts, and reactions to each others thoughts.
This project does not need have a sql database to keep track of the data as well as seeding it.

My motivation for this project was to take a deeper dive into mongoose and the way it works.
The reason I built this project was to have an understanding of how different schemas and models work together to store and show your data.
This will solve any issues with having to re-seed a database when you add new users, all you will need to do is start it up and enter the users information.
I learned how to complete project that stores its on data inside it when used and not having to seed a lot of information into it before you would like it to be there.


## Credits 
I looked back through the code in the bootcamp as well as many different online sources. My teacher and classmates helped with questions I had also.
